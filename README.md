# Let's do that again

You can now do hypothesis tests with two different distributions.  Let's consolidate what we have done by completing the previous exercise one further time.  Here for reference is our now familiar flow chart for hypothesis testing:

__To complete this task you must use the workflow illustrated in the flow chart above to test whether I am lying by telling you that the file `results.dat` here contains ten Bernoulli random variables with p=1/2__.  You need to start by working out what your null and alternative hypotheses are.  Furthermore, at variance with what you have done in previous exercises, you should use a __significance level of 10%__ here.   Based on the test you perform you then need to print whether the null hypothesis is rejected or if the evidence does not support the rejection of the null hypothesis.  Notice that the language you use here is important and the tests will fail if you do not use the correct phraseology.  

I have started you off by writing an outline for the various functions you will need to complete.
